# django-template-blocks

THIS IS A SOLO CLASSWORK

Use your previous movie app and base html files. Create template blocks in your index and about pages and create a new history page. Make sure your base html file includes a bootstrap jumbotron.

<strong>DO NOT</strong> use other students as help until they are finshed with their classwork. Use instructions provided by the tutorial (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/) as a starting point.

Template Block information can be found here:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/templates/language/#template-inheritance

Extra work:
On a side panel on your page, include only movie names.
